# Image-Transformation-Implementations

An BW image represented as a 2D vector may be rotated, scaled and translated about its basis vectors. As such, this project implements matrix equations that would indicate rotation, scaling, and translation for the 2D vector. In addition, these methods make use of the Cat image given (cat.png) and perform rotation (call it output1.png), scaling (call it output2.png), and translation (call it output3.png).
